In the realm of modern system management, observability has emerged as a crucial concept, enabling organizations to gain deep insights into the performance and behavior of their applications and infrastructure. However, despite its undeniable benefits, it often comes with a hefty price tag. Today you find companies tripping over each other trying to come up with the next great incremental innovation in pricing models and overall cost reduction techniques for storing logs, metrics, and traces.

So what happened over the years, that contributed to this exponential rise in observability cost?
- The breakdown of monolithic architectures and the adoption of microservices, along with the rise of complex cloud infrastructures, have significantly heightened the demand for very detailed observability. Microservices, by their nature, present substantial challenges in implementation and debugging. Without a lot of logs, metrics and traces, debugging failures within these systems and identifying their root causes is difficult.
- Over the last two decades, Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) providers and open-source technologies have progressively simplified the generation of large volumes of telemetry.
- The biggest problem of all is over 90% of telemetry data never gets queried. Observability vendors have been associating cost to data volume rather than data value.
