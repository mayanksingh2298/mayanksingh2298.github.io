They never tell you but the problem when you haven't seen a lot of failures in life is that you start to become a very risk averse person.

I'm so grateful I found strength to rise above that and focus all my energy on building my own company, CtrlB. Won't be an easy undertaking, but I'm sure it won't be my hardest.

What do we do? I will share much more soon, but we are going to stay in stealth a while longer while we work with more design partners and finish our go to market feature set. However, if you want a bit of a tease and a way to sign up to be notified when more info becomes available, check out our website at ctrlb.ai.

This is how I signed off my farewell email at my last company.
> “…, Though in reviewing the incidents of my administration I’m unconscious of intentional errors, I’m nevertheless too sensible of my defects, not to think it probable that I may have committed many errors. I shall also carry with me the hope that my country would view them with indulgence and after 45 years of my life dedicated to its service with an upright zeal, the faults of incompetent abilities will be consigned to oblivion as I myself would soon be, …” - George Washington’s farewell address (1796)
