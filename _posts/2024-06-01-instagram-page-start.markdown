I got into image generation couple weeks back. I've been experimenting with Stable Diffusion and Midjourney mostly and it's very fun using them. These are such happy images that no one would dislike seeing them every once in a while out of blue. So I started an instagram page - [@rcher.ai](https://instagram.com/rcher.ai) and started posting some of my stuff there.

It's been a week now and I've already got close to 500 followers. I have been DMing me specific scenes they have in their head and would like a wallpaper for their phones. So far it's been very fulfilling. I'll try to see how much am I able to scale this. As I started this, I began reading on how to grow instagram followers ([THIS REDDIT](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/787ic2/how_to_grow_any_instagram_account_complete_guide/)), I realized you need to do different things at different phases of your growth. Right now I use the follow/unfollow method to notify people of my existence and it seems to be working well.

Anyways, I'm hoping to grow this to atleast a few thousand followers. Here's to wishful thinking!
